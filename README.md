# DesignPattern

Design patterns are used to represent some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers.
A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. 
It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. 
It also gives implementation hints and examples.
